# ioBroker.Data-Solectrus (private)

Private ioBroker adapter that creates adapter-owned states and fills them every 5 seconds (wall-clock aligned).

- Configure outputs in Admin via a Master/Detail editor.
- Each output can be either a pass-through (source state) or a formula.
- Formula items support multiple inputs (source states) with variable names.

Note: The adapter name inside ioBroker is `data-solectrus` (instance: `data-solectrus.0.*`).

## Branding / Logo

This project intentionally does **not** ship any third-party logo (e.g. SOLECTRUS) to avoid trademark/copyright issues.
If you want to include the SOLECTRUS logo for a public upstream, please ask the maintainer/rights holder for explicit permission and add it afterwards.
